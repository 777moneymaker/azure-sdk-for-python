# Azure SDK Refactor

## Refactoring BUILD and VERSIONING into the `azure-sdk-tools` package for easy reuse and testing

While this is happening:

- [ ] Add Tests For Tricky Functions
- [ ] Add Type Hinting and Doc Comments (not enforcing parameter docstrings at this time)

Goals for the refactor:

- [x] Refactor `build` of packages (including conda packages) into command `sdk_build` accessible from `azure-sdk-tools`
- [x] Move necessary functions to support versioning (both requirement and package version updates) and build into `azure-sdk-tools`. Where a function has been moved out of `sanitize_setup.py` or `common_tasks.py`, call sites on _existing_ checks should be updated in place. So this means the current update takes care of updating versions and requirements + build. That's it.
  - [x] We will leave the current implementation of set_dev_version which simply updates package versions to daily alpha. That will be named sdk_build_version
- [x] Make `versioning` commands available in commands `sdk_version_X`
- [x] All functions should use CWD to establish where the root of the repository is or accept `--repo` as an argument which overrides that default.
- [x] Introduce --buildURL cli command that will _reproduce_ an error or build or scenario from a devops build URL.
- [x] We are _not_ updating logging with this first pr.

Minutae
- [x] Move `sanitize_setup` functions into `functions.py`
- [ ] Make a pass over all moved entry scripts. Ensure standardized arguments are present and working.
- [ ] Update Versioning scripts to be available from main
- [ ] Document new environment variables / Enhance Azure SDK Tools readme w/ Build/Versioning help
- [ ] Update the usings in tox_harness. Ton of dependencies that need to be cleaned up.
- [ ] Update existing call sites to enable CI to continue working post refactor start.

## Refactoring our logging

We have a lot of noise in our builds right now. We can stand to eliminate _some_ of the noise like output from `python setup.py bdist_wheel`. The issue is we don't want to come up with some hacked up workaround.

We want the logging to help you, and NOT BE IN YOUR WAY when you're trying to repro the issue. The first stage including build and versioning will not adjust any of our logging.

## Refactoring how we install required packages for `regression`, `min/latestdependency` and any of our test scenarios

Right now we essentially follow the standard of:

- Create tox environment based on preseeded requirements from earlier in the CI pipeline
- `[CI ONLY]` Process dev_requirements.txt to reduce relative dependencies to absolute paths to pre-built wheels (this avoids parallel access errors that WILL randomly happen within the parallel tox runs)
- Check dev_requirements.txt against actual package requirements. If we are running an environment that mandates specific package dependencies be installed (like minimum or latest), remove those requirements from the dev_requirements.txt.
- Install dev_requirements.txt and ci_tools.txt
- If necessary install specific requirements
- Install the package (from artifact directory or built at runtime)

What we _want_ is to have a scenario generator that offers the _options_ that we SHOULD test exposed as CLI arguments to command `sdk_scenario`.

We want to take into account:
- 1 or multiple dev feeds
- A prebuilt artifact directory or not for the package we are generating a scenario for
- Whether or not we are allowing `alpha` versioned dependendencies
- A `scenario`. Be it `latest`, `minimum`, `whl`, `sdist`

The method:

1. Examine the package. Are we grabbing it from a prebuilt directory? Are we in `dev_mode` (alpha versioned and requirements allow alpha) 
  - Add the resolved package reference to a `scenario.txt` 
2. Examine our dev_requirements. Do we need to do any pre-processing like we currently do in `tox_harness.py`? 
 - Pass set of requirements to the next phase.
3. Process package requirements.
  - Are we in dev mode? That affects our search
  - Select which versions of the requirements should be installed
  - Any requirements resolved in this phase supplant those in the dictionary passed from phase 2. 
  - Pass combination requirements to next phase.
4. Combine stripped down tox_environment_requirements.txt file to combination, with previous values holding weight over values from tox_environment_requirements.txt
5. Write entire combination of requirements to `scenario_name.txt`
6. The tox environment should install only azure_sdk_tools to start with, invoke `scenario_generator`, then install _that_ file. 
7. Check for the presence of a `ci_constraints.txt` which pins certain versions to help with test failures in CI.
8. Invoke tests as normal

## Refactor test invocation
