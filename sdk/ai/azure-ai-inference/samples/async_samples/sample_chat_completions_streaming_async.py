DESCRIPTION:
    This sample demonstrates how to get a chat completion streaming response
    from the service using an asynchronous client.

USAGE:
    python sample_streaming_chat_completions_async.py

    Set these two environment variables before running the sample:
    1) CHAT_COMPLETIONS_ENDPOINT - Your endpoint URL, in the form
        https://<your-deployment-name>.<your-azure-region>.inference.ai.azure.com
        where `your-deployment-name` is your unique AI Model deployment name, and
        `your-azure-region` is the Azure region where your model is deployed.
    2) CHAT_COMPLETIONS_KEY - Your model key (a 32-character string). Keep it secret.
