# Azure AMQP 1.0 library for Python


[Source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-amqp/) 
| [Package (Pypi)][package]
| [API reference documentation](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/main/sdk/core/azure-core/)


## Getting started

Typically, you will not need to install azure AMQP;
it will be installed when you install one of the client libraries using it.
In case you want to install it explicitly (to implement your own client library, for example),
you can find it [here](https://pypi.org/project/azure-amqp/).
